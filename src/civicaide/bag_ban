# Policy Evolution Report: ban single use plastic bags

## Executive Summary

The policy report explores three comprehensive strategies for reducing single-use plastic bags: support for retailers transitioning to biodegradable alternatives, a city-wide sustainable shopping initiative, and an incentivize reusable bags program. Each approach prioritizes sustainable practices, economic feasibility, and equity. The report provides detailed analyses on stakeholder impacts, potential implementation challenges, and economic considerations, emphasizing a structured and inclusive transition toward environmental sustainability.

## Top Policy Proposals

### 1. Transition Support for Retailers to Biodegradable Alternatives

Provide grants and technical support to local retailers to help them transition from plastic bags to biodegradable alternatives. Accompany with workshops and resources.

**Rationale**: Helping retailers transition smoothly ensures minimal economic disruption and supports sustainable business practices.

### 2. Comprehensive Sustainable Shopping Initiative

Develop a multifaceted city-wide initiative to promote sustainable shopping habits, focusing on reusable bags, to minimize the use of single-use plastics. The program will provide diversified incentives, including tiered loyalty rewards and strategic partnerships with local and regional businesses to offer attractive discounts. An extensive awareness campaign will be implemented, incorporating digital platforms, community workshops, and school programs to enhance public understanding of environmental impacts and sustainability. Additionally, the program will explore subsidies for reusable bags for low-income households to ensure equitable access.

**Rationale**: The enhanced proposal aims to build a robust and inclusive framework for encouraging sustainable shopping behaviors. By integrating advanced incentive structures and intensive education tailored to diverse community groups, the initiative not only promotes environmental mindfulness but also ensures broader participation and equity.

### 3. Incentivize Reusable Bags Program

Implement a city-wide program to incentivize the use of reusable bags by offering discounts or loyalty points to shoppers who bring their own bags. Partner with local businesses to support the initiative through marketing and rewards.

**Rationale**: By encouraging the use of reusable bags through incentives, the policy addresses consumer behavior without imposing an outright ban, offering a gentler transition and broader public acceptance.
