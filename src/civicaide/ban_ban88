# Context-Aware Policy Evolution Report: Ban on single use plastic bags

## Executive Summary

The policy report for Elgin, Illinois, proposes three key strategies to address the use of single-use plastic bags. These strategies focus on leveraging the city's vibrant arts community and involve local stakeholders to gradually transition to environmentally friendly practices. With a budget of $25,000, these proposals ensure the diversity and economic landscape of Elgin are respected while promoting sustainability and cultural pride.

## Top Policy Proposals

### 1. Elgin Bag Fee with Artistic Promotion

Implement a fee on single-use plastic bags while promoting the use of artistically designed reusable bags. Collaborate with local artists to create limited-edition bags sold to support environmental projects in Elgin.

**Rationale**: A fee discourages plastic use while funding supports community environmental efforts. The artistic promotion links cultural pride with environmental consciousness.

### 2. Elgin's Artistic Reusable Bag Initiative

This policy proposes a ban on single-use plastic bags and launches a community-driven campaign to design and distribute reusable bags through partnerships with local artists and schools. Bags would be sold at cost and distributed to low-income residents for free.

**Rationale**: Engaging the arts community aligns with Elgin’s cultural identity and creates vibrant, attractive reusable bags that encourage adoption. Community involvement fosters local pride and buy-in, increasing the likelihood of success.

### 3. Educational Campaign and Partial Plastic Bag Ban

This policy introduces a phased approach: an immediate ban on plastic bags over a certain size, coupled with an educational campaign targeting schools and businesses on the benefits of reducing plastic use.

**Rationale**: A partial ban allows time for businesses to transition and adapt operational strategies, while educational outreach creates informed consumers who support sustainable practices.
