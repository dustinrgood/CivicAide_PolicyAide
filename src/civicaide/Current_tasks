Based on the code review, here's my assessment of the context gathering functionality, focusing on the Census API workflow:
Strengths
Well-structured data models: The code defines clear Pydantic models for different types of data (LocationInfo, DemographicData, EconomicData, etc.), making it easy to validate and process data.
Robust Census API integration: The CensusAPI class handles:
API key management with environment variable fallback
Geography resolution (city → county → state)
FIPS code lookups with both the 'us' package and hardcoded fallbacks
Comprehensive demographic variable collection (population, age, income, race, education)
Error handling with informative logging
Graceful fallback mechanism: When the Census API fails, the system falls back to web search, ensuring the user experience is uninterrupted.
Structured agents approach: Uses specialized agents for different data gathering tasks (census_data_agent, economic_data_agent, government_structure_agent).
Comprehensive demo: The context_gathering_demo.py provides a clear demonstration of the workflow.
Areas for Improvement
Asynchronous fallback implementation: The _get_demographics_fallback method currently has placeholders and TODOs for proper async integration. This needs to be completed for a seamless fallback experience.
Limited census data processing: The racial composition calculation uses a simplified approach for Hispanic ethnicity that could be more accurate.
Error handling verbosity: There's extensive logging which is good for debugging but might be too verbose for production.
Census data validation: Some numeric values are checked for None or empty string, but there could be more robust validation of census data.
Streamlit integration: The profile_page.py uses a simulated data gathering process with mock data, but isn't yet integrated with the actual Census API functionality.
Population density calculation: While there's a field for population_density in the DemographicData model, it's not being calculated from Census data (would need geographic area information).
Recommendations
Complete the async fallback implementation in the _get_demographics_fallback method. This would make the Census API integration more robust.
Integrate Census API with Streamlit UI:
Replace the mock data in gather_jurisdiction_data function in profile_page.py with real Census API calls
Add proper loading states and error handling for API failures
Create a more seamless transition between real data and fallback data
Improve data caching:
Add caching for Census API results to reduce API calls
Store processed jurisdiction data to speed up subsequent profile views
Enhance error messaging:
Provide user-friendly feedback when Census API fails
Give clearer progress indicators during data gathering
Extend geographic capabilities:
Support for smaller geographic areas like census tracts
Add more geographic context like neighboring jurisdictions
Improve data visualization:
Add more charts in the profile page to visualize Census data
Create comparative visualizations against state/national averages
Add documentation:
Document required environment variables more clearly
Add example outputs to show what data looks like when using the real API
Refine logging:
Add structured logging that can be toggled between verbose/production modes
Separate debug logging from user-facing messages
The foundation for Census API integration is solid, with good fallback mechanisms. The main work needed is completing the async integration for fallbacks and connecting the API functionality to the Streamlit UI while maintaining the smooth user experience you've designed in the profile page.
