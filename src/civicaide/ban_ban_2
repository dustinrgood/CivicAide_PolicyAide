# Context-Aware Policy Evolution Report: ban on single use plastic bags

## Executive Summary

This final policy report explores strategies to effectively ban single-use plastic bags in Elgin, Illinois. The report outlines three key proposals: an educational campaign, a reusable bag design challenge, and a phased plastic bag phase-out with incentives. These proposals aim to leverage Elgin's strong community and arts resources while ensuring sustainability and equity. Implementation challenges, stakeholder impacts, and cost-benefit analyses are detailed, providing a roadmap for local government and community stakeholders to facilitate impactful change.

## Top Policy Proposals

### 1. Educational Campaign for Sustainable Bag Usage

Initiate a targeted educational campaign about the benefits of using reusable bags, involving workshops, social media, and local events.

**Rationale**: Increasing awareness and knowledge about environmental impacts will foster community-wide behavioral change without needing legislative enforcement.

### 2. Elgin Reusable Bag Design Challenge

Launch a city-sponsored competition inviting local artists to design custom reusable bags. The winning designs will be produced and distributed to promote sustainability and support the arts community.

**Rationale**: Leveraging the strong arts community in Elgin encourages local participation and creative engagement, while promoting the use of reusable bags effectively reduces the need for single-use plastics.

### 3. Plastic Bag Phase-Out & Incentive Program

Gradually phase out plastic bags over two years while providing incentives for using reusable bags, such as discounts at local businesses for patrons who bring their own bags.

**Rationale**: This phased approach allows businesses and residents to adapt to the change gradually and positively reinforces sustainable behavior.
