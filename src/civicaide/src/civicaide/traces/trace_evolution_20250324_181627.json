Stakeholder Acceptance\\n- **Small Businesses:**\\n  - **Policy 1:** May feel excluded unless guidelines address their needs.\\n  - **Policy 2:** Could benefit from AI applications improving public services, but may face uncertainty during pilots.\\n\\n- **Large Retailers:**\\n  - **Policy 1:** Favor regulatory clarity on AI use that supports compliance.\\n  - **Policy 2:** Appreciate efficiency improvements in public services impacting logistics.\\n\\n- **Low-Income Residents:**\\n  - **Policy 1:** Benefits from ethical guidelines ensuring fair technology use.\\n  - **Policy 2:** Gains from direct improvements in services like healthcare.\\n\\n- **Environmental Advocates:**\\n  - **Policy 1:** Supports caution and oversight.\\n  - **Policy 2:** Encourages applications improving traffic and air quality.\\n\\n- **Local Government Implementers:**\\n  - **Policy 1:** Simpler to start with advisory focus.\\n  - **Policy 2:** Challenges with coordinating and monitoring multiple pilots.\\n\\n- **Industry/Manufacturers:**\\n  - **Policy 1:** Provides clear regulatory environment.\\n  - **Policy 2:** Offers opportunities in AI development and deployment.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Policy 2 offers potential high direct benefits but with complexities; Policy 1 provides regulatory clarity.\\n\\n### Overall Effectiveness and Equity\\n**Policy 1** is superior in ensuring ethical use and equitable guidelines, offering a stable foundation with lower implementation complexity and cost. It supports long-term equity and environmental impacts through regulation. However, **Policy 2** offers more direct benefits through practical applications, immediate environmental impacts, and service improvements.\\n\\nTaking all stakeholders into account, Policy 2 might have greater immediate tangible benefits, especially in environmental and service efficiencies, but Policy 1 provides a necessary foundational framework for ethical AI integration that serves all stakeholders for sustainable impact.\\n\\n**Final Decision:** **Policy 1** is more effective and equitable overall, ensuring long-term ethical AI integration, with lower costs and complexity, benefiting all stakeholders by setting a solid regulatory stage for future AI developments.\", input_guardrail_results=[], output_guardrail_results=[], _last_agent=Agent(name='Policy Comparison Agent', instructions='Compare two policy proposals to determine which is more effective and equitable.\\n    \\n    Evaluate each policy based on these criteria:\\n    1.
