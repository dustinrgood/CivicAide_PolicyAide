It garners more stakeholder acceptance due to its comprehensive approach to fairness and oversight, which is crucial for maintaining trust across communities.\", input_guardrail_results=[], output_guardrail_results=[], _last_agent=Agent(name='Policy Comparison Agent', instructions='Compare two policy proposals to determine which is more effective and equitable.\\n    \\n    Evaluate each policy based on these criteria:\\n    1.
