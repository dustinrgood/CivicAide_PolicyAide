        "output": "\n    Based on my research on reducing single-use plastic waste in cities, here are some key findings:\n    \n    1. Plastic Bag Bans: Over 400 municipalities have implemented plastic bag bans or fees, with San Francisco being the first major U.S. city in 2007. These policies typically reduce plastic bag use by 70-90%.\n    \n    2. Straw Restrictions: Cities like Seattle and Miami Beach have restricted plastic straws, requiring businesses to provide alternatives only upon request.\n    \n    3. Comprehensive Approaches: Cities like Berkeley, CA have created \"Disposable-Free Dining\" ordinances requiring food vendors to use compostable foodware and charge for disposable cups.\n    \n    4. Public Water Stations: Cities like London and Paris have invested in public water refill stations to reduce bottled water consumption.\n    \n    5. Incentive Programs: Some cities offer tax incentives to businesses that eliminate single-use plastics or implement reusable packaging systems.\n    \n    Case studies of successful implementations include:\n    \u2022 Portland, Oregon achieved 52% reduction in plastic bag litter after their ban\n    \u2022 Ireland's plastic bag tax reduced consumption by over 90%\n    \u2022 Vancouver's comprehensive strategy targets straws, cups, bags, and takeout containers with a phased approach\n    \n    Most successful approaches combine regulations with public education campaigns and collaboration with local businesses.\n    ",

Feasibility: 8/10\n    - The phased approach makes implementation realistic and allows adaptation\n    - Infrastructure costs ($220,000) are reasonable for a city of 100,000\n    - Timeline is appropriately paced with education period\n    - The enforcement through existing code compliance avoids new bureaucracy\n    - Potential challenge: Ensuring adequate staffing for education campaign\n    \n    ## 2. Effectiveness: 9/10\n    - Comprehensive approach addresses multiple plastic waste streams\n    - Combines proven strategies (bans, fees, infrastructure)\n    - Targets highest-volume single-use items (bags, cups, straws)\n    - The phased approach with education increases likelihood of compliance\n    - Expected outcomes align with documented results in similar jurisdictions\n    \n    ## 3. Economic Impact: 7/10\n    - Short-term costs to businesses for transitioning to alternatives\n    - Business adaptation grants partially offset transition costs\n    - Potential for local economic development in alternative products\n    - Fee retention by businesses provides compensation for increased costs\n    - Consumers will face modest increased costs\n    \n    ## 4. Equity: 6/10\n    - Bag and cup fees could disproportionately impact lower-income residents\n    - No explicit provisions addressing accessibility needs for disabled persons\n    - Water refill stations have positive equity impact if strategically located\n    - Recommended improvement: Add fee exemptions for SNAP/WIC recipients\n    - Recommended improvement: Explicitly address disability accessibility concerns\n    \n    ## 5. Political Viability: 7/10\n    - Business incentive program helps build commercial support\n    - Recognition program creates positive publicity opportunities\n    - Education-first approach before enforcement reduces resistance\n    - Phased implementation demonstrates responsiveness to stakeholder concerns\n    - Potential opposition from specific industry groups remains likely\n    \n    ## Overall Assessment: 7.4/10\n    This policy proposal is comprehensive, well-structured, and incorporates best practices from successful implementations. The phased approach with emphasis on education and business support increases feasibility and political viability. Recommended refinements focus on addressing equity concerns and ensuring accessibility for all residents.\n    ",
